# Expense Classification Proof-of-Concept

## Overview

This repository showcases a proof-of-concept for classifying expense entries that fall outside predefined categories. By leveraging machine learning and NLP techniques, the project automatically identifies ambiguous expenses, enabling quicker human review and reducing manual effort. The approach involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation to deliver accurate classifications.

## Future Improvements

- **Category Analysis:** Conduct an in-depth study of expense categories to refine and optimize the classification process.
- **User Interface Enhancements:** Develop a user-friendly dashboard tailored for non-technical users, facilitating easy management and review of flagged expenses.
